AW: [Ticket#2016022310000601] Release date E-MTAB-3593 and E-MTAB-3591
Dear Amy:

Thanks for your fast reply.

Let's release first the files that are already deposited (fq-files). I do have bam files
for both submissions but I've to "zip" them and calculate MD5 Checksums etc. So that'll
take a bit of time. Once I am through with that I'd contact you again for further
instructions.

Best
Robert
